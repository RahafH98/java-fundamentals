**The linter**  
is designed to analyze a JavaScript file and identify lines that are missing semicolons based on specific criteria. When the linter runs, users should expect the following behavior and outcomes:

1. File Analysis
The linter reads through each line of the JavaScript file, one by one, analyzing its content.

2. Criteria for Semicolon Detection
For each line, the linter checks if certain conditions are met. It examines the line to determine whether it represents a statement that should end with a semicolon. These conditions include:

The line is not empty.
The line does not end with an opening curly brace {.
The line does not end with a closing curly brace }.
The line does not contain the keywords if or else.
The line does not already end with a semicolon ;.
Error Identification: If a line meets the criteria outlined above and is missing a semicolon, the linter registers an error for that line.

3. Error Message Generation
For each line that is missing a semicolon, the linter generates an error message indicating the line number and the nature of the error (missing semicolon).

4. Collecting Errors
The generated error messages are collected in a list.

5. Displaying Results
After analyzing the entire file, the linter displays the collected error messages (if any) to the user. If no errors are found, it indicates that no errors were detected.

Users should expect to see error messages for lines that violate the specified criteria for semicolon presence. The error messages will indicate the line number where the issue was found and the specific problem (missing semicolon). 

If no errors are found, the user will see a message indicating that no errors were detected.

Keep in mind that the linter follows the specific rules you've defined in the code. It doesn't perform a full analysis of JavaScript code and doesn't identify all possible issues or best practices. Users should interpret the linter's results within the context of the defined criteria and make necessary corrections to adhere to coding conventions and avoid potential pitfalls related to missing semicolons
